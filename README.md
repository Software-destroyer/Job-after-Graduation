# Job Platform Smart Contract

## Vision

The Job Platform Smart Contract is a decentralized application designed to connect students and companies on the Ethereum blockchain. By registering their profiles, students can showcase their qualifications and job preferences, while companies can list their job requirements. This facilitates a more transparent and efficient hiring process, making it easier for students to find job opportunities and for companies to discover potential candidates.

## Flowchart

The following flowchart illustrates the basic workflow of the Job Platform Smart Contract:

1. **Registration**:
   - **Student Registration**:
     - Student submits name, qualification, and job preferences.
     - The contract generates a unique student ID and stores the profile.
   - **Company Registration**:
     - Company submits name and job requirements.
     - The contract generates a unique company ID and stores the profile.

2. **Profile Retrieval**:
   - **Students**:
     - Query the contract with job preferences to get matching student profiles.
   - **Companies**:
     - Query the contract with job requirements to get matching company profiles.

3. **Updates**:
   - Profiles can be updated or queried based on new information or needs.


## Contract Address

The Job Platform Smart Contract is deployed on the Ethereum network. The contract address for interacting with the deployed contract is:

```
0x1b2caf7495fe7af19c3448d98a3e4c28bf0ca0bba3dc68a52d540bdc951f5d1c
```

Replace this placeholder with the actual address after deployment.

## Future Scope

1. **Profile Updates**:
   - Implement functionalities for users to update their profiles with new information.

2. **Advanced Search and Filtering**:
   - Develop enhanced search capabilities to improve matching accuracy between students and companies.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Add access control features to restrict certain actions to authorized users only.

4. **Front-End Interface**:
   - Build a user-friendly web interface to interact with the smart contract, improving usability.

5. **Integration**:
   - Explore integrations with other services or platforms to enhance functionality and user experience.
